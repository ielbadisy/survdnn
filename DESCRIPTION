Description: Provides deep learning models for right-censored survival data using the 'torch' backend. 
    Supports multiple loss functions, including Cox partial likelihood, L2-penalized Cox, time-dependent Cox, 
    and accelerated failure time (AFT) loss. Offers a formula-based interface, built-in support for cross-validation, 
    hyperparameter tuning, survival curve plotting, and evaluation metrics such as the C-index, Brier score, 
    and integrated Brier score. For methodological details, see Kvamme et al. (2019) <https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v20/18-424.html>.
