Description: Implements deep neural network models for right-censored survival data using the 'torch' backend. 
    Includes support for Cox loss, ranking loss, AFT loss, and model evaluation via C-index, Brier score, IBS, IAE, and ISE. 
    Provides a formula-based interface, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, plotting utilities, and extensible modular losses.
