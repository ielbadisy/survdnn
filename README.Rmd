`survdnn` implements neural network-based models for right-censored survival analysis using the native `torch` backend in R. It supports multiple loss functions including Cox partial likelihood, L2-penalized Cox, Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) objectives, as well as time-dependent extension such as Cox-Time. The package provides a formula interface, supports model evaluation using time-dependent metrics (e.g., C-index, Brier score, IBS), cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning.

---

## Features

- Formula interface for `Surv() ~ .` models
- Modular neural architectures: configurable layers, activations, and losses
- Built-in survival loss functions:
  - `"cox"`: Cox partial likelihood
  - `"cox_l2"`: penalized Cox
  - `"aft"`: Accelerated Failure Time
  - `"coxtime"`: deep time-dependent Cox (like DeepSurv)
- Evaluation: C-index, Brier score, Integrated Brier Score (IBS)
- Model selection with `cv_survdnn()` and `tune_survdnn()`
- Prediction of survival curves via `predict()` and `plot()`

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install from GitHub
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ielbadisy/survdnn")

# Or clone and install locally
# git clone https://github.com/ielbadisy/survdnn.git
# setwd("survdnn")
# devtools::install()
```

---

## Quick Example

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(survdnn)
library(survival, quietly = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)

veteran <- survival::veteran

mod <- survdnn(
  Surv(time, status) ~ age + karno + celltype,
  data = veteran,
  hidden = c(32, 16),
  epochs = 100,
  loss = "cox",
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

```{r}
summary(mod)
```

```{r}
plot(mod, group_by = "celltype", times = 1:300)
```

---

## Loss Functions

```{r}
# Cox partial likelihood
mod1 <- survdnn(
  Surv(time, status) ~ age + karno,
  data = veteran,
  loss = "cox",
  epochs = 100
  )
```

```{r}
# Accelerated Failure Time
mod2 <- survdnn(
  Surv(time, status) ~ age + karno,
  data = veteran,
  loss = "aft",
  epochs = 100
  )
```


```{r}
# Deep time-dependent Cox (Coxtime)
mod3 <- survdnn(
  Surv(time, status) ~ age + karno,
  data = veteran,
  loss = "coxtime",
  epochs = 100
  )
```

---

## Cross-Validation

```{r}
cv_results <- cv_survdnn(
  Surv(time, status) ~ age + karno + celltype,
  data = veteran,
  times = c(30, 90, 180),
  metrics = c("cindex", "ibs"),
  folds = 3,
  hidden = c(16, 8),
  loss = "cox",
  epochs = 100
)
print(cv_results)
```

---

## Hyperparameter Tuning

```{r, eval = TRUE}
grid <- list(
  hidden     = list(c(16), c(32, 16)),
  lr         = c(1e-3),
  activation = c("relu"),
  epochs     = c(100, 300),
  loss       = c("cox", "aft", "coxtime")
  )

tune_res <- tune_survdnn(
  formula = Surv(time, status) ~ age + karno + celltype,
  data = veteran,
  times = c(90, 300),
  metrics = "cindex",
  param_grid = grid,
  folds = 3,
  refit = FALSE,
  return = "summary"
  )
print(tune_res)
```

---

## Plot Survival Curves

```{r}
plot(mod1, group_by = "celltype", times = 1:300)
```


```{r}
plot(mod1, group_by = "celltype", times = 1:300, plot_mean_only = TRUE)
```
